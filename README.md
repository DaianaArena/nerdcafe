## My personal Next.js+Typescript+Tailwind boilerplate

This project was created from [my personal Next.js+Typescript+Tailwind boilerplate](https://github.com/DaianaArena/react-zoho-widget-boilerplate). Feel free to use it if you like it! If you do, please visit my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arenadaiana/) to say thanks 	:grin: remember it helps me a lot ♥


## Before Installation - System Requirements

Make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

 - Node.js 16.8 or later.
 - MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

**_Note:_** While the pages directory requires Node.js v14 or later, the app directory requires Node v16.8.0 or later.

## Getting Started

First, install all the  dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
